# DefinitionMatchGame
This interactive tool helps medical students strengthen recall and comprehension through active matching. You’ll drag term “chips” onto their corresponding definitions; correct matches turn green and disappear, while incorrect attempts flash red briefly. A timer tracks your progress.
How to Use the Program    
Paste a Markdown table of Definitions and Terms to Match into the text box.


Click Load Data to start a new game.


Toggle Shuffle Definitions if you want random order each round.


Drag terms onto matching definitions until all are correctly paired.


View your total time when finished.
Prompt for Generating Tables (use in ChatGPT or AmbossGPT):
 Create a Markdown table for a drag-and-match study game. Use the following parameters:
term_number: total number of terms to include (e.g., 10)


content_focus: the topic or body system covered (e.g., renal physiology, autonomic pharmacology, cranial nerves)


difficulty: easy, medium, or hard — determines how detailed or specific the definitions should be


Output the table in this exact format so it can be copied into the game:
| **Definition** | **Term to Match** |
|-----------------|------------------|
| ... | ... |

Each definition should be clear, accurate, and clinically relevant. Avoid trivial or ambiguous phrasing. Use consistent capitalization and terminology appropriate for a first-year medical student preparing for Step 1. Include overlapping or conceptually linked terms only when helpful for reinforcement.

Good Luck!
